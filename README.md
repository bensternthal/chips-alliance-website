# CHIPS Alliance Website

This site is based off of [the Sendit Hugo theme](https://github.com/CloudCannon/sendit-hugo-template) and will eventually power [chipsalliance.org](https://chipsalliance.org/).

## Develop

This theme was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) version `0.96.0`, but should support newer versions as well.

### Prerequisites
* Hugo [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). `brew install hugo`
* Go [install](https://go.dev/learn/). `brew install go`

### Quickstart
1. In the terminal at the root dir, run: `npm i`
2. Start site: `hugo server`. The site will be at: [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/)
