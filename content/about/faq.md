Open source ingredients for hardware design are enabling and accelerating the global collaborative ecosystem. They encourage the formulation of new, disruptive ideas that drive the industry forward, decrease cost and time needed to build new processing platforms, and give users more control over the technology stack and the ability to co-design software and hardware more effectively.
