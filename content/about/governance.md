   The CHIPS Alliance is a directed fund of [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/), a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization.  Following best practices in the industry, we maintain a clear and consistent separation of responsibilities between technical and non-technical governance decisions. The CHIPS Alliance operates under its Charter.

In addition to the top-level structure of The CHIPS Alliance, each hosted open source project has its own process, structure, and community.  While the Technical Steering Community (TSC) sets high-level technical policy, projects have a great deal of flexibility in day-to-day operations.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The Technical Steering Committee, or TSC, is responsible for the technical oversight of the CHIPS Alliance.  The TSC is responsible for implementing technical policy and procedures within the scope and direction of the policies set by the Governing Board, such as defining and maintaining neutral consensus on the technical vision for CHIPS Alliance projects, shepherding projects through their technical lifecycle, and identifying, recruiting, and engaging prospective projects.

The TSC operates openly and transparently, and consists of elected representatives from each CHIPS Alliance workgroup. TSC meetings are open to all, and both members and non-members may earn the right to participate in all TSC governance processes.
