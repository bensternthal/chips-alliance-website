   The CHIPS Alliance is a directed fund of [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/), a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization.  Following best practices in the industry, we maintain a clear and consistent separation of responsibilities between technical and non-technical governance decisions. The CHIPS Alliance operates under its Charter.

In addition to the top-level structure of The CHIPS Alliance, each hosted open source project has its own process, structure, and community.  While the Technical Steering Community (TSC) sets high-level technical policy, projects have a great deal of flexibility in day-to-day operations.
